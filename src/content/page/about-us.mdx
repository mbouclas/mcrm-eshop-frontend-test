# We are our achievements
For over 30 years -and going strong- we have been a family business. As for our team,
we acknowledge that they are the people that make everyday business happen and
regard them as our extended family. Every step, from customer service to design
creation to printing, is done in-house since it is important to us to control the quality
throughout. Our 2,000 m2 privately owned printing facilities allow us to be prompt,
precise, and maintain a strong, interpersonal relationship with each of our clients no
matter how big, unconventional, or last-minute the request.

We continue to be leaders in our field. Fueling our passion for memorable and inspired
promo gifts, we offer the best possible in promotional merchandise; unique and clever
corporate choices that leave an impression upon their receivers and can be used again
and again. Alongside our clientele, we have evolved since 1990 and tirelessly expanded
our services and collections.

RPS Promotions was the first company in Cyprus to perform full-color silk printing
allowing your designs to come to life with impressive durability. Also, we have never
stopped adding new materials, colors, and printing methods of the highest quality and
standards. Our printing services vary from the more common ones, like pad printing,
screen printing, and laser engraving, to the more demanding ones like hot stamping,
embroidery, and digital printing. We work with diverse materials such as glass, wood,
recycled plastic, PLA, clay, recycled PET felt, coconut, organic cotton, natural jute,
recycled cardboard, natural stone, bamboo, cork, and many more. Emphasizing the use
of naturally sourced, sustainable, eco-friendly yet resistant raw materials, we contribute
to keeping the planet alive for the generations to come.

From day one, we always respected our people, the job, and our clients with whom we
maintain a close relationship. Every single printing creation is up to our and your
standards. Having customers not only in Cyprus but from around the globe keeps us
vigilant while continuously upgrading and modernizing our process chain.
So come on into our gift printing world. Letâ€™s create a corporate gift that will wow your
customers.
